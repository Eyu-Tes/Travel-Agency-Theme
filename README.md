# Travel-Agency-Theme
This project is based off of the YouTube tutorial [Build A Travel Agency Theme With Materialize CSS 1.0.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaP3vO-vEsg) by *Brad Traversy*.  In this video, a single-page travel website is built using HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, Materialize framework.  This project is an extension of the original code and has been modified to use the Bootstrap framework.
